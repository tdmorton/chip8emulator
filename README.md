# Building
To build, run

```
make
```

This will create a chip8 file

# Running

To run the program, use:

```
./chip8 [-d] [-h] rom.ch8
```

The rom filename will need to end in ".ch8" to be parsed correctly.

The escape key can be pressed at any time to exit.

# Cleaning

To clean up the directory, run

```
make clean
```

This will remove the chip8 executable
